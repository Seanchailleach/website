<a href="https://www.meted.ucar.edu/education_training/course/23" target="top">SkyWarn Spotter Training</a>--Two courses, no cost. Can
be taken online, but some areas may require that you attend in-person training (also free) in order to be certified.
<br><br>

Interpretation lesson costs about $4 USD. 
<br><br>
<a href="https://www.universalclass.com/i/course/learn-meteorology-basics.htm" target="top">Universal Class Meteorology Class</a>--Costs 
about $100 USD, but if you have a library card, check your library's web site. Mine offers free unlimited access to Universal Class.
<br><br>

<br<br>
<a href="https://training.weather.gov/wdtd/courses/" target="top">NWS/NOAA Training Courses</a>--Meant
for forecaster training; but as far as I can tell, they're free for anyone to take online. Includes Radar & Applications, 
Warning Operations, and more.
