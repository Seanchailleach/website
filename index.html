<p>Hi y'all, and warmest greetings from beautiful Kentucky, USA! I'm the Weather Witch, <i>an Seanchailleach</i>, a Mimi, a programmer, and an 
unapologetic weather nerd.</p>

<p>My hope for this little web site is to show how nature (including weather) and witchcraft are intertwined. 
What witch doesn't relish a good ol' thunderstorm? As many witches are herbalists and gardeners, learning to read the weather is an important 
skill and part of understanding nature. Of course, nowadays we have radar, weather stations, <a href = "https://www.weather.gov">
the National Weather Service</a> and other agencies, TV, radio, and the Internet to keep us informed, rather than having to rely on 
folk wisdom and intuition entirely. But it doesn't hurt to have them all in your wheelhouse!</p>

<p>What does the future hold for this page? A little discussion about what witches are (people who live in rhythm with nature) and what they
aren't (turning people into toads), how they work with nature and the cycles of the seasons, along with some weather facts, safety tips for 
severe weather, discussions about home weather stations...the sky's the limit! (No pun intended.)</p>
 
<p>Not gonna lie, my HTML skills are from the 1990s so this is going to be a long-term and tedious (at least for me) project. Expect numerous,
and hopefully frequent, updates. I promise pics and prettiness and witchy nature stuff in the future! But for now, I plan to plug along a bit 
every day.</p>
<br><br>
<p> A little taste of my local (as in, "literally, my front yard") weather conditions:</p>
