Hi y'all! Suzy the Weather Witch here with a peek at my local <i>(literally my front yard)</i> weather conditions. 
Not gonna lie, my HTML skills are from the 1990s so this is going to be a long-term web page project. Expect numerous,
and hopefully frequent, updates. I promise pics and prettiness and witchy nature stuff in the future!
