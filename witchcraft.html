The Truth About Witches
</font>
</center>
<font type="Georgia" size=5 color="white">
<p>Why do we, in modern times, believe that the women* who were tortured, executed, and banished for witchcraft were actually doing baneful magic? Or that they had the power to cause crops to fail, 
or that they ate babies, or whatever they were accused of? I think if we put on our Grown-Up Logical Thinking Caps, it will be blatantly obvious that none of this was true. So why the persecution? 
Why the lies and fear and misinformation?</p>

<p>Short answer: the religious patriarchy of the day. Life in the 15th century was pretty bleak for women. Marry. Cook. Clean. Wash clothes. Pop out a baby every year while still keeping up with 
the cooking and cleaning and laundry. Obey your husband because he's better and smarter than you. Oh, and all because God said so. Now please note, I respect everyone's religious/spiritual beliefs 
as long as they 1) cause no harm, 2) are chosen freely, and 3) help you become a better, more compassionate person. Unfortunately, it's still true today that most people will never question the 
religion they are born into, and will live their lives assuming that whatever their religion teaches is the only definition of a "good and moral person." Many will never study other spiritual 
paths or have any reason to question the values of their own--but at least the option to learn exists nowadays. Not so much back then, so there was no argument and no way out.</p>

<p>The "witches" (I call them our First Feminists) were usually older women who gained a lot of knowledge through life experience and observation. They lived in harmony with nature, they knew what 
crops to plant and when, which herbs would bring down a fever, and how to support other women in childbirth. Knowledge is power, especially if that knowledge is only acquired by a small number of 
people. And the menfolk said "You can't be doin' that."</p>

<p>One only need look as far as American politics to see how quickly even the most outrageous lies can spread and be believed. And oh, how the Church lied! Growing herbs? They're for a magic 
potion for invisibility! Baby didn't survive childbirth? The witch (midwife) must have stolen the living baby and eaten it! Man has a crush on a woman? She hexed him with a love 
spell! They're causing droughts! They're flying on broomsticks! They're turning people into toads! They're eating cats and dogs! (No, wait--that last one is American politics.)</p>

<p>So women who didn't conform to the ideal of the Perfect Christian Wife and Mother** were accused of witchcraft. This not only included "because they know stuff," but also any physical 
blemishes--scars, moles, birthmarks--and any unusual personality quirks were deemed to be "of the devil." The lucky ones were only fined or banished or excommunicated. Others were tortured, and 
their children taken and tortured in front of them, until they confessed that yes, that rosemary growing in the garden is defintitely part of a spell to curse the town and not at all for, 
like, seasoning food. And so they were hanged, drowned, or burned.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that women today take back the label of "witch" for themselves as empowered women--women who heal, support, nurture. Women who live by the cycles of the seasons and regard nature 
as something sacred. Women who believe that the masculine and the feminine are <b>equal</b> parts of the whole, with neither being "better" or "more important" than the other. Women who are strong 
and wise, but willing to learn. THIS is witchcraft today.</p>
<br><br>
<i>* To be fair, some men were accused of witchcraft as well; but, yes, mostly women.
<br>
** Not picking on Christianity specifically, but it WAS the religion being used to persecute people at the time. I'm also not knocking any woman's FREE CHOICE to be a traditional wife, homemaker, 
and mother--but there wasn't a lot of "free choice" going around back then.</i>
