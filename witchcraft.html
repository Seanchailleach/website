Why "The Weather Witch?"

<font type="Georgia" size=5 color="white">
<p>Most people don’t understand what a “witch” really is. No, they don’t fly around on broomsticks, turning people into toads (believe me, 
if that were possible, I’d be all over it; I already have a Toad List). A witch is basically anyone—male, female, or otherwise—who lives 
life in tune with nature and the cycles of the seasons, and who gathers wisdom from the natural world. Witches were/are herbalists, 
gardeners/farmers, midwives, healers of all sorts, the elders of their communities—and yes, weather watchers!</p>

<p>While I do not intend this site to be specifically about witchcraft, I thought it interesting that the practice of witchcraft includes 
weather watching and forecasting. Although it may seem silly in today's world of amazing technology, keep in mind that a lot of today's 
science comes from these "old ways." People who live in harmony with nature are generally more aware of tiny shifts that may have big impacts 
down the line.</p>

<p>The term "weather witch" is new to me as a specific type of witch. I honestly admit that I'm still learning, and therefore will not at this 
time attempt my own take on it; I'm no more qualified to explain weather witchery than I am to explain the intricate details of how Doppler 
radar works. I've included links in the side frame so you can do your own research.</p>
