Why "The Weather Witch?"
</font>

<p>Most people don’t understand what a “witch” really is. No, they don’t fly around on broomsticks, turning people into toads (believe me, 
if that were possible, I’d be all over it; I already have a Toad List). A witch is basically anyone—male, female, or otherwise—who lives 
life in tune with nature and the cycles of the seasons, and who gathers wisdom from the natural world. Witches were/are herbalists, 
gardeners/farmers, midwives, healers of all sorts, the elders of their communities—and yes, weather watchers!</p>

<p>While I do not intend this site to be specifically about witchcraft, I thought it interesting that the practice of witchcraft includes 
weather watching and forecasting. Although it may seem silly in today's world of amazing technology, keep in mind that a lot of today's 
science comes from these "old ways." People who live in harmony with nature are generally more aware of tiny shifts that may have big impacts 
down the line. Have you ever seen the TV show <i>Psych</i>? It's about a young man who convinces the police department to hire him as a psychic to 
help solve cases. But he wasn't actually psychic; he was just incredibly observant (and this was a LEARNED skill that was taught by his 
father). He was able to see tiny little clues that were overlooked by others--and to those who did not possess this skill, this 
certainly seemed like psychic abilty.</p>

<p>The term "weather witch" is new to me as a specific type of witch. I've included links in the side frame so you can do your own 
research, as I don't feel qualified to dig too deeply just yet. But I will offer my <i>opinion</i> about some of the material I've read 
so far...and I'm a bit disappointed. Most resources I've found are more focused on spells to CHANGE the weather--repelling storms, or causing 
rain during a drought, etc. Again, just my opinion, but I find that a bit unfair. Witches were falsely accused of all sorts of awful 
things, and bad weather was one of them (see this <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbressan/2015/11/30/how-climate-change-triggered-literal-witch-hunts-through-the-ages/" target="top">link</a>). 
Now, I'm a believer in positive intent and energy manipulation (to an extent), but I'm also a logical person. Witches weren't pointing 
sticks at the sky, saying magic words, and causing instantaneous weather change. They learned, through experience, what types of clouds 
and wind conditions meant rain vs. sunshine. In short: they were just better prepared to handle whatever the weather 
happened to do. Just like the young man in <i>Psych</i>, they had observational skills that seemed "otherworldly" to people who 
weren't as observant.</p>

<p> Even in this day and age, to my logical and science-based mind, a lot of things seem like "magic" because I don't know how 
they work. Now imagine back in the 15th/16th century, how magical almost any kind of knowledge would seem to those who did not possess
it. Especially when those who watched the sky and predicted a dry season planted drought-resistant crops, while everyone else's water-loving 
crops withered. Knowledge is indeed power, and the whole point of knowledge is that you're supposed to LEARN it.</p>
