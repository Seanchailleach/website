Sharing Your Weather Data

<p>You've got your weather station set up, all seems to be working as expected, and you have access to your weather data via your console 
and/or phone app. So...now what? If you would like to share your data with others, there are several ways to do so (and you are not 
limited to just one method). I share mine with Ambient Weather, Weather Underground, and the NWS. Depending on the brand of weather 
station you have, there may be other options for sharing as well.</p>

<p>The Ambient WS-2000 console makes it pretty easy to share with Ambient and Weather Underground; this is accomplished through the console 
settings. Sharing with the NWS is a bit more complicated, requiring a <a href="http://www.wxqa.com/cwop_info.htm" target="top">CWOP</a> 
account, confirming my station on FINDU, and getting a MADIS ID.</p> 

<p>Why would you want to share your weather data? Because the NWS can use it to improve their computer model data for your area, as well 
as allow for more accurate weather forecasting. This is especially true if you (like me) live in a small town outside of a large 
metroplitan area. With an influx of data from surrounding areas, model data will be more accurate for those of us living outside the city.

Forecast Office, but the overall idea is the same wherever you live.)</p>
